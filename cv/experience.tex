\textbf{MTS AI} \hfill June 2022 - Present \\
Senior Machine Learning Engineer

Development of a Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text, and ASR services that outperform leading competitors in the Russian language.

\textbf{Responsibilities:}

\begin{itemize}[left=0pt, label={--}]
    \item Model deployment using Triton Server, Docker, Kubernetes, Python, and Golang.
    \item Model optimization for performance and resource efficiency:
    \begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt]
        \item Model architecture changes
        \item TensorRT, tritonlang, torchcompile and OpenVINO
        \item Model warmup, quantization, sparsity and pruning
    \end{itemize}
    \item Research, develop, train and fine-tune new model architectures.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Achievements:}

\begin{itemize}[left=0pt, label={--}]
    \item \textbf{0.12} p95 latency and \textbf{90} RPS for diffusion model on a single \textbf{2g.20Gb} A100 instance.
    \item Established and automated a version-controlled model deployment process using CI/CD, WandB / ClearML, and Artifactory.
    \item The development process was established following best practices (e.g., CI/CD, code review, documentation, unit testing, changelog, semantic versioning, etc.).
    \item Created an automated quality and performance testing in a production-like Kubernetes environment.
    \item Implemented comprehensive observability with monitoring, logging, and alerting.
